          # Why?

          Javascript is rapidly transforming as our applications become more ambitious.

          Note:
            - Some explanation for this talk…
            - Javascript is changing rapidly
            - can be a bit intimdating
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          - 1999: ECMAScript 3
          - ECMAScript 4 was abandoned
          - 2009: ECMAScript 5
          - 2015: ECMAScript 2015
          - 2016: ECMAScript 2016

          Note:
            - Tons of new features are being added to the language
            - Modules, classes, generators
            - Future specifications include decorators for functions and method, async/await, and more
            - There is so much new territory for people to familiarize themselves with
            - Talks exploring these new features can help make the process less intimidating

          # Why modules?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Javascript used to be relatively simple.

          ```
          &lt;a onclick=&quot;alert('gimme pizza')&quot;&gt;helll yahhh&lt;/a&gt;
          ```
          Note:
            - Our JavaScript applications used to be relatively simple
            - Existed on "one line"
            - Handled primarily simple interactivity, form validation, etc.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          But our applications are much more ambitious now.
          ```
          {{#link-to 'pizza'}}helll yahhh{{/link-to}}
          ```
          Note:
            - But our applications are becoming more ambitous
            - This demands a whole new level of structure and organization to our code
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background-image="jt.gif">
          Note:
            Most of my code samples deal with pizza for some reason so…get ready
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          `import` and `export` have been reserved keywords in Javascript from the beginning

          Note:
            The words 'import' and 'export' were defined as reserved keywords in the original javascript specification

            (It would be interesting to know why that was?)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          But Javascript had no built in system for modularity

          Note:
            but JS has never had a built in system for handling modularity


            If a developer working on a more complex application wanted to organize their code in a more modular fashion

            which means that code was shared across the global scope
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
            …with no interface or namespacing, creating headaches and barriers to collaboration
            ```javascript
            // utils.js
            function slice(arr, n) {
              // ...
            }
            ```

            ```html
            &lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
            &lt;script src=&quot;utils.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script src=&quot;pizza.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
              var slice = new Slice('plain');
              // conflicts with slice in utils.js
            &lt;/script&gt;
            ```

            Note:
              This limits stablity and  maintainablity of your code, and makes it difficult to collaborate with others, etc.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Now we have multiple ways of handling modules.

          ```
          // commonjs
          class Pizza {
            // ...
          }

          module.exports.Pizza = Pizza;

          // amd
          define(['Pizza'], function () {
            class Pizza {
              // ...
            }

            return Pizza;
          });
          ```

          Note:
            Eventually, javascript developers solved this problem on their own, by creating their own standards and libraries for handling modules

            Unfortunately, many of these implementations are incompatible with each other, leading to long debates over which modular system is the best, etc.,

            and leading to a complicated package ecosystem
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Many languages were able to avoid such a conflict by having a built-in interface for modules
          ```python
          # pizza.py
          class Pizza:
            def __init__(self, toppings):
              self.toppings = toppings

          def Slice:
            def __init__(self, type):
              self.type = type

          # main.py
          from pizza import Slice
          ```
          Note:
            Many languages avoided this kind of debate and competition through having a built-in specification and interface
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Having a built in specification for Javascript provides one standard for everyone to follow

          Note:
            Javascript has one now as of July, with the publication of the modual specification in ES2015.

            Developers of packages have one way of distributing their code, and users have one way of consuming them

            But as I'll touch on later, this only creates the potential for cleaning up our package ecology, getting there will likely be more complicated

          # ES2015 Module Basics
          - No `modules` or `define` keywords
          - Just `import` and `export`
          - No need to `use strict`
          - Multiple exports(!)

          Note:
            So what are ES2015 modules? The basics

            - First there's only import and export, no modules or define
            - Every ES2015 module is in strict-mode by default
            - And one of the biggest deals about Es2015 is that modules can have more than one export
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Exports have to be declared.

          You can export `function`, `class`, `var`, `const`, and `let`.
          ```javascript
          // toppings.js
          export const combo = ['pineapple', 'feta'], // 😋

          // pizza.js
          export class Pizza {
            constructor(toppings) {
              this.toppings = toppings;
            }
          }
          ```

          ```javascript
          // index.js
          import { combo } from './libs/toppings';
          import { Pizza } from './libs/pizza';

          let pizza = new Pizza(combo);
          ```

          Note:
            Just like in CommonJS, exports have to be explicity declared. Nothing is exported unless you say it is.

            Exports have to be named.

            Exports can be given a type.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          You can have multiple `export`s…

          ```javascript
          // toppings.js
          export const plain = [],
          export const pepperoni = ['pepperoni'],
          export const combo1 = ['pineapple', 'feta'],
          export const combo2 = ['pepperoni', 'sausage', 'people'];
          ```

          Note:
            You can have all the exports you want in a module
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          …or you can `export` a list…

          ```javascript
          // toppings.js
          const plain = [],
                pepperoni = ['pepperoni'],
                combo1 = ['pineapple', 'feta'],
                combo2 = ['pepperoni', 'sausage', 'people'];

          export { plain,
            pepperoni,
            combo1,
            combo2 }
          ```

          Note:
            Although, you might think exporting a list of values is more clear
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          …and rename your `export`s.

          ```javascript
          const plain = [],
                pepperoni = ['pepperoni'],
                combo1 = ['pineapple', 'feta'],
                combo2 = ['pepperoni', 'sausage', 'people'];

          export { plain,
            pepperoni,
            combo1 as pineappleAndFeta,
            combo2 as meatLovers }
          ```

          Note:
            And for the sake of clarity, you might choose to rename your exports
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          And you can do the same with `import`s.

          ```javascript
          // index.js
          import { plain as noToppings,
                   meatLovers as meeeat } from './libs/toppings';
          import { Pizza } from './libs/pizza';

          let pizza1 = new Pizza(noToppings),
              pizza2 = new Pizza(meeeat);
          ```

          Note:
            But you might also choose to rename them as their consumed by an import
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          You can also namespace `import`s as an object

          ```javascript
          // index.js
          import * as toppings from './libs/toppings';

          let plain = new Pizza(toppings.plain);
          ```

          Note:
            You could also do that through namespacing your imports as an object
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          And you can re-export modules from other dependencies

          ```javascript
          export { default as plain } from "./pizzas/plain";
          export { default as pepperoni } from "./pizzas/pepperoni";
          export { default as pineappleAndFeta } from "./pizzas/pineappleAndFeta";
          export { default as meatLovers } from "./pizzas/meatLovers";
          ```

          Note:
            There are also times where all you want to do is rename and re-export something from an external library or dependency, in which case you can re-export from another source like so
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          But what about `default`?

          Note:
            There is also a `default` keyword, which has the benefit of providing some backward compatability with older module systems
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          CommonJS and AMD modules only export once.

          Note:
            As i've said, CommonJS and AMD can only export once.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Those exports become equivalent to `default` in ES2015
          ```javascript
          import _ from 'lodash';
          // import { default as _ } from 'lodash';
          // var _ = require('lodash');

          let log = console.log.bind(console);

          export default log;
          // export { log as default }
          // module.exports = console.log.bind(console);

          ```

          Note:
            So, ES2015 treats those single exports from older modules essentially as the default export, named "default"
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <section data-markdown>
          # Rules for implementation

          No nested `import`s or `export`s
          ```javascript
          const date = new Date();

          if (date.getDay() === 3) {
            // wednesday is pizza day
            import { plain } from './all'; // this should fail
          }
          ```

          Note:
            For implementing ES2015 modules, there are a few rules

            First, import and export can be at the top level only
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          An implementation must load all imported modules recursively.

          Note:
            Every import is only completed after all of that modules external dependencies have been loaded

            This has been the main thing holding up standardization and implementation of the module specification
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Linking

          ```
          // all.js
          export { default as plain } from "./pizzas/plain";
          export { default as pepperoni } from "./pizzas/pepperoni";
          export { default as pineappleAndFeta } from "./pizzas/pineappleAndFeta";
          export { default as meatLovers } from "./pizzas/meatLovers";

          // index.js
          import { taco } from './libs/all.js'; // this should fail
          ```
          ![tacocat](cat.gif)
          Note:
            An import can't link to something that isn't being exported

          Browser support?

          Note:
            So, one might wonder, what does this look like in the browser?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          💁

          Note:
            This is unclear, to me. Various proposals and ideas for how modules should be implemenated in the browser have been exchanged, but no stable implementation exists in any browser, yet.

            And the main thing seems to be how to fetch all the required dependencies?

            HTTP/2 could change this, potentially

          # Transpilers &amp; Bundlers
          - [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/)
          - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

          Note:
            So if we want to use ES2015 modules we'll have to transpile and bundle our code, for this, we'll use Rollup and Babel
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          # Using Rollup
          - By @Rich_Harris
          - [rollupjs.org](rollupjs.org)
          - Embraces ES2015 modules
          - CLI or Node module
          - Simple configuration
          - Plugins for interfacing with npm, Babel

          Note:
            Rollup is a relatively recent tool created by Rich Harris from the Guardian.

            This is a tool I'm just becoming familiar with, but figured I couldn't not talk about when talking about ES6 modules

            (he lives here and maybe he is here in which case…I hope I explain this right?)

            rather than simply transpiling ES6 module syntax to commonjs, rollup embraces the es6 module implementation

            it comes as either a simple CLI or as a node module to use in your applications

            it also has useful plugins for interfacing between rollup and npm, babel, etc.

            i won't go too deeply into how to use rollup.

            if you want to find out more you can go to the rollup site or repo and scope out their documentation (and their wiki, which is one of the best sources of information out there on es6 modules)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          # "Tree-shaking"
          Rollup only bundles what you need
          ```javascript
          // pizza.js
          export class Pizza { ... }
          export class Slice { ... }

          // index.js
          import { Pizza } from './pizza';
          console.log(Pizza(['veggies', 'more veggies']));

          // bundle.js
          export class Pizza { ... }

          console.log(Pizza(['veggies', 'more veggies']));
          ```

          Note:
            One of the especially cool features of rollup is "tree shaking" which allows rollup to produce minimal bundle sizes by only importing the code that's actually *used*

          We can't take full advantage of ES2015 modules if they're not written as ES2015 modules

          Note:
            The advantages of the ES2015 module spec won't be able to be realized without actually writing ES2015 modules?

            But most of the packages we use in our day-to-day work are written as CommonJS modules

        <section data-markdown>
          But publishing Javascript is already complicated

          Note:
            And publishing code is already complicated enough, between all the different standards that need to be supported

          You can use `jsnext:main` to point toward ES2015 source
          ```json
          {
            "name": "pizza",
            "version": "9.0.0",
            "main": "dist/pizza.js",
            "jsnext:main": "dist/future-pizza.js"
          }
          ```

          Note:
            If you do publish es6 modules, you can use the "jsnext:main" property in your package.json file to point toward your ES6 source

          A possible opening for lots of new open-source contributions?

          Note:
            But it's a lot to ask maintainers to rewrite all their code as ES6 modules,

            which means this is a potentially huge opening for open source contributions to start to push our javascript code toward embracing this new feature?

          ```

          Note:
            I also set up a small repo on github for people who might not know how to totally get off the ground with Es6 modules a little sandbox to play with to start getting familiar with es6 module syntax, rollup, babel, etc., so you can just clone that and run npm install to get started

          # Getting Started
          ## With ES6 Modules

          ```javascript
          import { talk } from './aaron-petcoff';
          // TODO: ^-- this is cheesy. remove this.
          // @ughitsaaron on the twitters
          // web developer at _new york_ magazine
          // http://aaronpetcoff.me
          ```

          Note:
            My talk today is on Getting Started with ES6 modules.

            As the title suggests, this talk is geared toward helping people who are excited about this new feature in Javascript get going, but hopefully there‚Äôs something from this talk that everybody can be excited about.

          # Why?
          - 1999: ECMAScript 3
          - 2009: ECMAScript 5 (ES4 was abandoned)
          - June 2015: ECMAScript 2015
          - Next year: ECMAScript 2016

          Note:
            Ten years passed between the publication of the ES3 specification and ES5. ES5 was published in 2009 and ES6/ES2015 was published just in June, introducing radical new features and concepts to the language including modules, immutable constants, block scoping, class syntax, generators, native promises, and so much more.

            TC-39 wants to publish the specification for the next version of JavaScript later this year (making it ES2016), which might include class decorators, async/await, an exponents operator, and more.

            Javascript is evolving rapidly. Often more than many developers can keep up with. Talks  that explore the reasoning, use, implications, and implementations of these new features are useful for helping developers at all levels consider how the language Javascript is changing, evolving, and growing.

          # Modules

          - Organization
          - Dependency management

          Note:
            The word ‚Äúmodule‚Äù might be an overloaded term.

            For instance, some could consider CSS or Sass files imported through the use of `import()` to be ‚Äúmodular‚Äù and they‚Äôre not wrong‚Äìbut CSS `import` includes the whole stylesheet into the document as more or less could be accomplished through concatenation. (I believe this is also the way that `include` works in C?)

            Doing this has benefit of allowing users to separate concerns, hiding code that isn‚Äôt immediately relevant, allowing for a greater degree of clarity and organization in a complex program.

            No interface or namespacing

            ```javascript
            // tools.js
            function map(arr) {
              // ...
            }

            // index.html
            var map = L.map('map') // conflicts with map from tools.js
            ```
            <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

            Note:

            "But lacking an interface for interacting with the code being included can cause a lot of headaches for developers and teams."

        <section data-markdown>
          Languages like Python have a built in interface for modules.
          ```python
          # math.py
          def fib(n):
            # some Fibonacci function

          def fib2(n):
            # some other Fibonacci function

          # main.py, only uses one function from math.py
          from math import fib2
          ```

          Note:

          Many languages, therefore, offer a built in syntax for managing modularity, to prevent conflicts like this.

          # Modules in Javascript

          `import` and `export` have been reserved keywords in Javascript since 1997

          Note:
            The words import and export have been reserved keywords since the first ECMAScript specification in 1997.

            But, until recently, JavaScript has never had a built in method for making or consuming modules.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Once upon a time‚Ä¶
          ```
          &lt;a onclick=&quot;whatever('ok, cool')&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
          ```

          Note:
            And in some ways, this made sense: for a long time, Javascript programs existed to handle small bits of interactivity.

            Most Javascript programs existed on a single line, or within small `script` tags.

          But our applications are much more complex now.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Libraries became more common.

          Distributed across the global scope, e.g., `window.jQuery`

          Note:
            "But the web evolved. Javascript programs became more complex, creating greater needs for developers to reuse code or rely on libraries to handle complex tasks or manage conflicts between browsers."

            "But sharing across the global scope is bad‚Äìit introduces the potential for valuable code to be overwritten if two global variables share the same name, not to mention it could potentially make secure data or functions available to the public."
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          CommonJS &amp; AMD

          ```
          // commonjs
          module.exports.foo = 'yahh';

          // amd
          define(['foo'], function () {
            return 'yahh';
          });
          ```

          Note:
            Developers eventually created their own ways of handling modules, through things like CommonJS and AMD.

            Node‚Äôs adoption of the CommonJS specification for modules meant a rapid proliferation of packages developed using this standard. But AMD has also been popular.

            Each implementation has it‚Äôs own strengths &amp; weaknesses.

            Unfortunately, these two standards are incompatible with each other.

          Note:
            A common, built in standard gives us one common interface for handling the exporting and importing of Javascript modules.

          # ES2015 Module Basics
          - No `modules` or `define` keywords
          - Just `import` and `export`
          - No need to `use strict`
          - Multiple exports(!)

          Note:
            No more `modules` keyword. Instead, you simply `export`.

            No need to ‚Äòuse strict‚Äô -> all ES6 modules are in strict mode already.

            Like with other common Javascript module systems, everything declared in a module remain local to the module unless they‚Äôre explicitly exported.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Have to manually expose code.

          ```javascript
          // toppings.js
          const combo = ['pineapple', 'feta'], // üòã
                  favoriteCombo = combo; // won't be exported

          export combo

          // pizza.js
          export class Pizza {
            constructor(toppings) {
              this.toppings = toppings;
            }
          }
          ```

          Can export `function`, `class`, `var`, `const`, and `let`.

          Note:
            To expose code from inside a module we have to export it.

            We can name our exports with function, class, let, const, var.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```javascript
          // index.js
          import { combo } from './libs/toppings';
          import { Pizza } from './libs/pizza';

          let pizza = new Pizza(combo);
          ```

          Note:
            Then we just have to import the exported code where we want it.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          You can `export` a list‚Ä¶

          ```javascript
          const plain = [],
                pepperoni = ['pepperoni'],
                combo1 = ['pineapple', 'feta'],
                combo2 = ['pepperoni', 'sausage', 'people'];

          export { plain,
            pepperoni,
            combo1,
            combo2 }
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ‚Ä¶and rename your `export`s.

          ```javascript
          const plain = [],
                pepperoni = ['pepperoni'],
                combo1 = ['pineapple', 'feta'],
                combo2 = ['pepperoni', 'sausage', 'people'];

          export { plain,
            pepperoni,
            combo1 as pineappleAndFeta,
            combo2 as meatLovers }
          ```

          Note:
            Perhaps you have specialty combinations that share similar names, `combo1` and `combo2`.  These names don‚Äôt tell you much about what kind of information they actually have‚Äìsimply that they‚Äôre combos, so when you export them you want them to have a more useful name.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Naturally, the same goes for `import`s.

          ```javascript
          // index.js
          import { plain as myPizza,
                   meatLovers as ew } from './libs/toppings';
          import { Pizza } from './libs/pizza';

          let pizza1 = new Pizza(myPizza),
              pizza2 = new Pizza(ew);
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          You can also `import` as an object

          ```javascript
          // index.js
          import * as toppings from './libs/toppings';

          let plain = new Pizza(toppings.plain);
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          But what about `default`?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          CommonJS and AMD modules can only export once.

          Note:
            ES2015 modules see CommonJS and AMD modules as having one "default" export.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```javascript
          import _ from 'lodash';
          // equivalent to var _ = require('lodash');
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```javascript
          // log.js
          export default console.log.bind(console)
          // equivalent to module.exports = console.log.bind(console);
          ```

          Note:
            You can export defaults, too.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Re-exporting modules

          ```javascript
          export { default as plain } from "./pizzas/plain";
          export { default as pepperoni } from "./pizzas/pepperoni";
          export { default as pineappleAndFeta } from "./pizzas/pineappleAndFeta";
          export { default as meatLovers } from "./pizzas/meatLovers";
          ```

          Note:
            You can re-export modules.

          ```javascript
          // this will fail
          const date = new Date();

          if (date.getDay() === 3) {
            // if it's wednesday, get a plain pizza
            import { plain } from './all';
          }
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          An implementation must load all imported modules recursively.

          // index.js
          import { bbq } from './libs/all.js'; // this will fail

        Can't take full advantage of modules if they're not written as ES2015 modules.

        Libraries like lodash already have ES2015 implementations. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

        ```json
        {
          "name": "pizza",
          "version": "9.0.0",
          "main": "dist/pizza.js",
          "jsnext:main": "dist/future-pizza.js"
        }
        ```
        <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
        Note:
          "jsnext:main is like main, but points to the es6 implementation"
